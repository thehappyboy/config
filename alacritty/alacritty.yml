# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g.

# Hints
#
# Terminal hints can be used to find text or hyperlink in the visible part of
# the terminal and pipe it to other applications.
#hints:
# Keys used for the hint labels.
#alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

# List with all available hints
#
# Each hint must have any of `regex` or `hyperlinks` field and either an
# `action` or a `command` field. The fields `mouse`, `binding` and
# `post_processing` are optional.
#
# The `hyperlinks` option will cause OSC 8 escape sequence hyperlinks to be
# highlighted.
#
# The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
# `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
#
# The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
# the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
#
# If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
# shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
# (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs and applies only to
# `regex
